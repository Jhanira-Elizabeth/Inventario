## Project Overview
This is an Ionic Angular mobile application for inventory management at NetStar company in Ambato. The app manages equipment and materials with role-based access control.

## Architecture & Technologies
- **Framework**: Ionic 7 with Angular 18+ (Standalone Components)
- **Database**: SQLite with Capacitor for local storage
- **State Management**: Angular Services with RxJS
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **QR/Barcode Scanning**: Capacitor Camera plugin
- **UI Framework**: Ionic Components

## User Roles & Permissions
1. **Administrador (Administrator)**
   - Full CRUD access to materials, works, users
   - Complete reporting access
   - User management capabilities

2. **Encargado (Manager)**

- `materials/` - Material CRUD and inventory management
- `works/` - Work project management
- `users/` - User management (admin only)
- `reports/` - Reporting and analytics

- Secure local data storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session management with automatic logout

## Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use OnPush change detection strategy
- Optimize images and assets
